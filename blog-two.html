        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="par-one">
          Similar to other programming languages, HTML has certain conventions
          and methods to efficiently write code. I worked with C# last year and
          for most of the year, I was the only person reading and altering my
          code. For our final exam, we worked in groups; to ensure that my group
          members understood my code, I had to practice certain conventions that
          I previously bypassed. This took longer and became frustrating. I
          would like to practice the conventions I am taught consistently from
          the beginning to ensure that I do not repeat my mistakes. I do enjoy
          HTML and look forward to exploring the language more.

          Reflections On The Reading And The Case Study:
        </h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="par-one">
          I did not realise how sheltered I was when growing up. When I started
          university, I became aware of screen readers, and several other
          life-altering scenarios. I also think that because of my cultural
          background, my peers at the time would feel obligated to hide these
          life-altering scenarios. I would like to do more research into the
          different ways that I can improve my code to ensure that people who do
          face these scenarios can interact with my websites, apps, etc. In
          terms of the reading, Why Choose HTML5, emphasises certain practices
          to ensure that websites are accessible to all. It was a very packed
          reading that had several sections, excuse the pun, that I struggled to
          grasp but as I become more "fluent" in HTML, I do think that certain
          practices will become second nature.

        <h3 class="section-one">Internet Histories:</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="par-one">
          The growth and development of the internet have always fascinated me.
          It feels as if one day I stared at a simple HTML document with minimal
          images and quite a bit of text, and the next day there was this
          aesthetic masterpiece of a website that had several different
          capabilities and functionalities. Then again, I remember when I argued
          that the speed of a 3G network was faster than the speed of light, now
          I rub my temples in frustration whenever I run a speed test and it is
          below 8MBps. The timeline illustrates how far the internet has
          moved/evolved from its initial creation. I look forward to playing
          role in future developments in websites and the internet as a whole.
