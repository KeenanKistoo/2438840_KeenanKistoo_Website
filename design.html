      <h3 class="section-one">Colour Choices:</h3>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p class="par-one">
        Throughout this block, I have learnt several different accessibility
        scenarios. I chose very natural colours like black, white, beige, and
        grey. I tried to research more about colour vision deficiency but, I
        resorted to staying more to natural colours. However, I would like to
        implement more colours into my website and try and have settings to
        apply filters for people who live with different types of colour vision
        deficiency. I did not want to make too many assumptions before I had
        done all the necessary research and ultimately do more harm than good.

      <h3 class="section-one">Background and Font:</h3>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p class="par-one">
        I have used Times New Roman throughout my website. It reads easily and
        also gives off this classic writing style impression. There were other
        font choices such as Arial Narrow, etc. but I chose against this due to
        readability.
      </p>
      <p class="par-one">
        For the homepage, the wall is supposed to act as a signboard. And the
        icons on the corner of the buttons act as drawing pins or thumbtacks.
      </p>
      <p class="par-one">
        For the other pages, the paper background makes it seem like a journal
        entry. It is also subtle and consistent, so there is nothing that is
        popping out of the screen or drawing unnecessary attention.

        The overall goal is to create a website that allows the user to easily
        navigate through. To achieve this, I would need to ensure that every
        interactive element is clearly displayed on the website, there is a
        clear loop where users can get to and from wherever they need to, and
        the website communicates to the user where they are on the website. I
        have decided to use a navigation bar to ensure this communication.
