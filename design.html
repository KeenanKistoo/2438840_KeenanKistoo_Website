      <h3 class="section-one">Thought Process:</h3>
      <p class="par-one">
        I spent a lot of time trying to implement each wireframe instead of
        using it as a reference. I do think that wireframing is something that I
        need to improve on. I selected the one that I felt consistently drew
        focus to the purpose of the website. With many of the other wireframes,
        I had several pictures that became a bit overwhelming to deal with and
        took away from the blogs.

      <h3 class="section-one">Colour Choices:</h3>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p class="par-one">
        Throughout this block, I have learnt several different accessibility
        scenarios. I chose very natural colours like black, white, beige, and
        grey. I tried to research more about colour vision deficiency but, I
        resorted to staying more to natural colours. However, I would like to
        implement more colours into my website and try and have settings to
        apply filters for people who live with different types of colour vision
        deficiency. I did not want to make too many assumptions before I had
        done all the necessary research and ultimately do more harm than good.

      <h3 class="section-one">Background and Font:</h3>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p class="par-one">
        I have used Times New Roman throughout my website. It reads easily and
        also gives off this classic writing style impression. There were other
        font choices such as Arial Narrow, etc. but I chose against this due to
        readability.
      </p>
      <p class="par-one">
        For the homepage, the wall is supposed to act as a signboard. And the
        icons on the corner of the buttons act as drawing pins or thumbtacks.
      </p>
      <p class="par-one">
        For the other pages, the paper background makes it seem like a journal
        entry. It is also subtle and consistent, so there is nothing that is
        popping out of the screen or drawing unnecessary attention.

      <div class="line"></div>
      <p class="par-one">
        The overall goal is to create a website that allows the user to easily
        navigate through. To achieve this, I would need to ensure that every
        interactive element is clearly displayed on the website, there is a
        clear loop where users can get to and from wherever they need to, and
        the website communicates to the user where they are on the website. I
        have decided to use a navigation bar to ensure this communication.

      <p id="userflow-text">
        The flowchart is a very basic illustration on how a user can navigate
        through my website. It shows the continous loop between pages but also
        shows that the user can only veiw the blog posts by clicking on the blog
        section. From the blog section, the user has the option to navigate to
        any other page of the website.

      <p class="par-one">
        I built my blog page similarly to the link above. I liked the idea of
        displaying the blog posts chronologically and with a short description
        expressing what the user is about to read. I initially had a grid with
        all my blog posts, but when asking people to navigate through my
        website, there were quite a few misunderstandings where users read
        certain aspects in the wrong order. For the future though, I do think I
        can incorporate certain filtering buttons that allow people to view the
        website in different ways.

      <h3 class="section-one">Implementation</h3>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p class="par-one">
        Classes and IDs made the implementation process quicker and helped me to
        be more efficient. The classes allowed me to standardise different
        aspects and IDS allowed me to make small changes for images and text
        that differed slightly.
      </p>
      <p class="par-one">
        I did have a small issue implementing images. The images would not load,
        and my alternative text would be displayed. I fixed this by placing
        different icons, wireframes, and images in different folders. This was a
        very weird instance but hopefully, I can find a more efficient and fool
        proof method at a later stage.
